README

First off thank you for purchasing this SKYBOX file for Unity 3D.

To get you started quickly there are two options listed below in the instructions to use the SKYBOX- option (a), (b):

Method (a) allows you to add the SKYBOX to a specific camera while option (b) applies the SKYBOX on a global level.
The difference between the two is that applying the SKYBOX to the camera will allow for a different SKYBOX option per scene (good if you have several scenes and you want various times of the day; morning, afternoon, evening etc) whereas the Global option is more of a blanket across the whole project.
The decision is up to you and based upon your specific needs.


**To get started follow the directions below to import the SKYBOX into the project following steps 1-6. To then apply the SKYBOX globally follow steps 7-10 or skip down to the section explaining how to add the SKYBOX to a specific camera!


1. Either begin a new project or open your existing project

2. Under ASSETS tab select the 'import package' tab

3. Navigate to the downloaded PlasmaSky.unitypackage and click open

4. The program will begin decompressing the file and then when the new dialog box opens select import

5. Under your Project panel you will see the PlasmaSky.unitypackage

6. Click the arrow to expand the folder and you will see a folder called 08 which contains the source images for the skybox at 1024x1024 and a material called PlasmaSky_Skybox

7. To activate the Skybox in your scene select the Edit tab and then Render Settings (To apply the SKYBOX to a camera see instructions below)

8. Under the Inspector panel between Ambient Light and Halo Strength you will see the PlasmaSky_Skybox Material

9. Select the dropdown arrow next to Skybox Material and then select the premade PlasmaSky_Skybox material

10. Your Skybox should now be activated and loaded in the New Project or your exisiting scene

**To add a SKYBOX to a specific camera simply follow these directions:

1. Select the camera within your scene

2. Go to the componet > Rendering > Skybox

3. This will add a new SKYBOX section in the inspector which allows you to select a specific SKYBOX for that camera only
